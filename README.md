# Fresh-Dns

Idea is to make a simple bash function in ec2 to run several parallel dnsvalidators at every 24 hrs (starting a 8:00 PM IST) to send a push request to this repo for the fresh list of resolvers.
So that subdomains could be resolved easily just by cloning this repo's resolvers.txt and run it againt your favourite tool sets.

That it ! :p
